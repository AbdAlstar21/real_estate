The system includes two applications: a user application and a Dashboard application. The control (management) application consists of a main page that includes four main interfaces represented by a management interface (users - properties - types - notes). Each interface has its own settings and sub-interfaces. Before viewing the main page in the application, you must log in. As for the user application, it consists of a main page that includes several interfaces in which the properties are displayed according to a specific order in each interface (such as displaying properties according to the number of preferences - according to the property description - according to the property type...), in addition to a side menu that contains a set of settings, in addition to an interface that displays the user's favorite properties. The user must also log in to the application, and if he does not have an account, he can create his own account. In this chapter, the main interfaces in the two applications will be displayed.
